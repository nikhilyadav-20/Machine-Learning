# House Price Prediction using EDA and Linear Regression
# Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a dataset that contains various features related to housing. The workflow involves:

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data, identify patterns, and discover important relationships between features. Implementing Linear Regression as the predictive model to estimate house prices based on the features.

# Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset (CSV file) used in the analysis. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the code for EDA and Linear Regression. scripts/: Python scripts for data processing, visualization, and model building. results/: Output files such as visualizations, model performance metrics, etc. README.md: Project description and instructions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features that influence house prices, such as:

Lot Area: The size of the lot (in square feet). Overall Quality: A rating of the overall material and finish of the house. Year Built: The year the house was built. Total Rooms: Total number of rooms in the house. Neighborhood: The location of the house. Sale Price: The target variable representing the house price. (You can either provide the link to the dataset here or mention that the dataset is included in the data/ folder.)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, we explore the following:

Summary statistics to understand the distribution of the data. Missing data analysis and handling of missing values. Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to detect patterns and insights.

# Linear Regression Model
After the EDA, a Linear Regression model is built to predict house prices based on the most important features identified during the analysis. The process includes:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features). Splitting the data into training and testing sets. Training the Linear Regression model. Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn Jupyter Notebook (optional for running notebooks) Install the dependencies using:

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine. bash Navigate to the project directory. bash Copy code cd house-price-prediction Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and build the model, or run the Python scripts from the command line: bash Copy code jupyter notebook notebooks/eda_and_regression.ipynb Or for Python script: bash Copy code python scripts/linear_regression.py

# Results
The results of the analysis include:

Insights from the EDA phase such as key features affecting house prices. A trained Linear Regression model that can be used to predict house prices. Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.

# Future Work
Possible improvements or next steps:

Implementing other machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to compare performance. Feature engineering to improve model accuracy. Deploying the model using Flask/Django for a web-based application.
